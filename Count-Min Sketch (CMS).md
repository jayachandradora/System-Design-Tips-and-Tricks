# Count-Min Sketch: Use Cases and Java Implementation

## Use Cases

1. **Frequency Estimation in Data Streams**:
   - Count-Min Sketch is ideal for estimating the frequency of elements in large data streams where storing exact counts for each element is impractical due to memory constraints.

2. **Network Traffic Monitoring**:
   - It can be used to monitor and analyze network traffic by estimating the frequency of different types of packets or requests in real-time.

3. **Clickstream Analysis**:
   - Analyzing user behavior on websites or applications by estimating the frequency of page views, clicks, or actions.

4. **Distributed Systems**:
   - Count-Min Sketch can be used in distributed systems to aggregate statistics or counts across multiple nodes efficiently.

5. **Load Balancing**:
   - In load balancing algorithms, it can estimate the load on different servers by counting incoming requests or transactions.

## Implementation Details in Java

### Count-Min Sketch Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class CountMinSketch {
    private int depth;
    private int width;
    private int[][] sketch;

    public CountMinSketch(int depth, int width) {
        this.depth = depth;
        this.width = width;
        this.sketch = new int[depth][width];
    }

    // Hash functions
    private int hash1(String key) {
        return Math.abs(key.hashCode() % width);
    }

    private int hash2(String key) {
        // A different hash function to ensure independence
        return Math.abs((key.hashCode() * 31) % width);
    }

    // Increment the count of key in the sketch
    public void increment(String key) {
        for (int i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
            int index = (hash1(key) + i * hash2(key)) % width;
            sketch[i][index]++;
        }
    }

    // Get the estimated count of key
    public int estimate(String key) {
        int minCount = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
            int index = (hash1(key) + i * hash2(key)) % width;
            minCount = Math.min(minCount, sketch[i][index]);
        }
        return minCount;
    }

    // Print the sketch table for debugging
    public void printSketch() {
        for (int i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sketch[i]));
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountMinSketch cms = new CountMinSketch(5, 100); // Depth 5, Width 100

        // Example usage
        String[] data = {"apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "apple"};
        for (String key : data) {
            cms.increment(key);
        }

        // Estimate counts
        System.out.println("Estimated count of 'apple': " + cms.estimate("apple"));
        System.out.println("Estimated count of 'banana': " + cms.estimate("banana"));
        System.out.println("Estimated count of 'cherry': " + cms.estimate("cherry"));

        // Print the sketch table
        System.out.println("\nSketch table:");
        cms.printSketch();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

   - **Depth and Width:** depth determines the number of hash functions and width specifies the size of the sketch array.

   - **Hash Functions:** hash1 and hash2 are used to compute the indices for storing and retrieving counts in the sketch. They should be independent to minimize collisions.

   - **Increment Method:** Increases the count of the specified key in each row of the sketch based on its hashed indices.

   - **Estimate Method:** Retrieves the minimum count of the key across all rows in the sketch, providing an estimate of its frequency.

   - **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to increment counts for a set of keys ("apple", "banana", "cherry") and estimate their frequencies using the Count-Min Sketch.

### Considerations:

   - **Accuracy:** The accuracy of Count-Min Sketch depends on the chosen depth and width. Increasing these values improves accuracy but also increases memory usage.

   - **Collision Handling:** Hash functions should be chosen carefully to minimize collisions and ensure that each hash function provides independent indices.

   - **Memory Efficiency:** Count-Min Sketch uses a fixed amount of memory (depth x width) regardless of the number of distinct keys observed, making it suitable for large-scale data streams.

Implementing Count-Min Sketch in Java allows for efficient frequency estimation and summarization of large data streams, making it a powerful tool in scenarios where memory and real-time processing are critical considerations.
Adjust depth and width based on your specific requirements for accuracy and memory usage.
