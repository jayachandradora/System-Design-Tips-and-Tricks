  - Usage: The largest unit of digital storage measurement; used in theoretical discussions about the total amount of digital data in existence.


# Capacity Estimation during System Design Interviews

During a system design interview, capacity estimation is crucial for demonstrating your ability to analyze requirements and scale a system effectively. Here's a simplified approach to perform capacity estimation:

### 1. Understand Requirements:

- **Define Use Cases**: Clearly understand the primary functions of the system (e.g., messaging, e-commerce, social media).
- **User Base**: Estimate or be given the number of active users.
- **Traffic Patterns**: Identify peak usage times and expected growth rates.

### 2. Break Down Components:

- **Identify Components**: Determine the major components such as web servers, application servers, databases, and external APIs.
- **Data Storage**: Calculate storage requirements for user data, content (e.g., photos, videos), and transactional data.

### 3. Apply Rough Estimates:

- **Use Rules of Thumb**: Employ general guidelines for estimating:
  - **Bandwidth**: Assume average data transfer rates or usage patterns.
  - **Storage**: Estimate based on data types and volumes (e.g., transactions per user, media storage).

### 4. Example Calculation:

- **Bandwidth**: Estimate based on average data usage per user (e.g., messages sent/received per day).
  - Example: Assume 1,000,000 users, each sending/receiving 20 messages/day (200 bytes/message).
    - Daily Data Volume = 1,000,000 * 20 * 200 bytes = 4,000,000,000 bytes = 4 GB/day
    - Peak Load Factor = 2 (for peak times)
    - Peak Data Volume = 8 GB/day

- **Storage**: Calculate based on user data, transactional data, and media content.
  - Example: Assume user profiles (1 KB each) and transactional data (4 GB/day).
    - User Profiles = 1,000,000 * 1 KB = 1,000,000 KB = 1,000 MB = 1 GB
    - Messages (1 day) = 4 GB/day

### 5. Consider Scalability:

- **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**: Discuss strategies for scaling horizontally (adding more servers) or vertically (increasing server capacity).
- **Load Balancing**: Address load distribution across servers to manage traffic efficiently.

### 6. Justify Assumptions:

- **Explain Reasoning**: Clearly articulate your assumptions and reasoning behind your estimations.
- **Discuss Trade-offs**: Consider trade-offs between performance, cost, and infrastructure complexity.

### Tips:

- **Practice**: Familiarize yourself with common scenarios and calculations before the interview.
- **Communication**: Clearly communicate your approach, assumptions, and calculations to the interviewer.
- **Iterate**: Be prepared to adjust your estimations based on feedback and further discussion during the interview.

By following these steps and tips, you can approach capacity estimation confidently during a system design interview, showcasing your ability to analyze requirements and design scalable systems effectively.
