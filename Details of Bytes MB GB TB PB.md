# Details of Bytes, MB, GB, TB, PB, etc.

- **Byte (B)**:
  - Definition: The basic unit of digital information storage.
  - Equivalence: 1 Byte = 8 bits.
  - Usage: Typically used to measure small amounts of data.

- **Kilobyte (KB)**:
  - Definition: 1 KB = 1,024 bytes.
  - Equivalence: 1 KB = 2^10 bytes.
  - Usage: Often used to measure small files, text documents, or small images.

- **Megabyte (MB)**:
  - Definition: 1 MB = 1,024 KB = 1,048,576 bytes.
  - Equivalence: 1 MB = 2^20 bytes.
  - Usage: Commonly used to measure larger files, photos, music files, and short videos.

- **Gigabyte (GB)**:
  - Definition: 1 GB = 1,024 MB = 1,073,741,824 bytes.
  - Equivalence: 1 GB = 2^30 bytes.
  - Usage: Used for measuring larger amounts of data, such as full-length movies, large software applications, and extensive databases.

- **Terabyte (TB)**:
  - Definition: 1 TB = 1,024 GB = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes.
  - Equivalence: 1 TB = 2^40 bytes.
  - Usage: Commonly used for measuring storage capacities of hard drives, SSDs, and large-scale data storage solutions.

- **Petabyte (PB)**:
  - Definition: 1 PB = 1,024 TB = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes.
  - Equivalence: 1 PB = 2^50 bytes.
  - Usage: Used for measuring very large data volumes, such as in data centers, cloud storage, and big data applications.

- **Exabyte (EB)**:
  - Definition: 1 EB = 1,024 PB = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes.
  - Equivalence: 1 EB = 2^60 bytes.
  - Usage: Rarely encountered in everyday applications; used in contexts of extremely large data volumes.

- **Zettabyte (ZB)**:
  - Definition: 1 ZB = 1,024 EB = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 bytes.
  - Equivalence: 1 ZB = 2^70 bytes.
  - Usage: Primarily theoretical and used in forecasts for future global data storage and traffic.

- **Yottabyte (YB)**:
  - Definition: 1 YB = 1,024 ZB = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 bytes.
  - Equivalence: 1 YB = 2^80 bytes.
  - Usage: The largest unit of digital storage measurement; used in theoretical discussions about the total amount of digital data in existence.
