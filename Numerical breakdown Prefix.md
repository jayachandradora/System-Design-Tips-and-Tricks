# Large Numbers: Prefixes from Thousands to Quintillions

Here's a breakdown of the numerical prefixes used for large numbers, starting from thousands up to quintillions:

1. **Thousand**: 1,000 (10^3)

2. **Ten Thousand**: 10,000 (10^4)

3. **Hundred Thousand**: 100,000 (10^5)

4. **Million**: 1,000,000 (10^6)

5. **Ten Million**: 10,000,000 (10^7)

6. **Hundred Million**: 100,000,000 (10^8)

7. **Billion** (US): 1,000,000,000 (10^9)
   - **Billion** (UK and some other countries): 1,000,000,000,000 (10^12)

8. **Ten Billion** (US): 10,000,000,000 (10^10)

9. **Hundred Billion** (US): 100,000,000,000 (10^11)

10. **Trillion** (US): 1,000,000,000,000 (10^12)
    - **Trillion** (UK and some other countries): 1,000,000,000,000,000 (10^15)

11. **Ten Trillion** (US): 10,000,000,000,000 (10^13)

12. **Hundred Trillion** (US): 100,000,000,000,000 (10^14)

13. **Quadrillion** (US): 1,000,000,000,000,000 (10^15)

14. **Ten Quadrillion** (US): 10,000,000,000,000,000 (10^16)

15. **Hundred Quadrillion** (US): 100,000,000,000,000,000 (10^17)

16. **Quintillion**: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10^18)

These prefixes continue similarly for higher numbers, each increasing by a factor of 1,000 (thousand) compared to the previous one. They are used to express very large quantities in a standardized and concise manner. The definitions of "billion" and "trillion" can vary depending on the country or region, as noted with the US and UK definitions.
