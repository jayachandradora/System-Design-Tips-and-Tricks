## CDC (Change Data Capture)

CDC (Change Data Capture) in real-time scenarios refers to the process of capturing and tracking changes made to data in databases or data streams as they occur. This capability is essential for applications that require up-to-date information and need to react quickly to changes. Hereâ€™s how CDC works in real-time scenarios:

### How CDC Works:

1. **Capture Changes**: CDC systems monitor the source data for any modifications, additions, or deletions. This monitoring can occur at different levels:
   - **Database Level**: Capture changes directly from the database transaction log, which records all data modifications (inserts, updates, deletes).
   - **Application Level**: Integrate with applications or services to capture changes as they occur in real time.

2. **Log-based Capture**: For databases, CDC often utilizes the transaction log (or redo log) maintained by the database management system (DBMS). The log contains a sequential record of changes made to the database, including timestamps and the specific operations performed (insert, update, delete).

3. **Change Detection**: CDC systems continuously monitor the transaction log or data streams for new entries or changes. When a change is detected, metadata such as the affected tables, columns, and type of operation (insert, update, delete) is captured.

4. **Propagation and Delivery**: After capturing changes, CDC systems propagate this information to downstream systems or applications in real time or near real time. This ensures that consumers of the data have access to the most current information.

5. **Processing and Transformation**: In some cases, CDC systems may transform or enrich the captured data before delivering it to downstream systems. This can involve data normalization, filtering, or aggregating changes based on business rules or requirements.

6. **Usage in Real-Time Applications**:
   - **Analytics and Reporting**: Provide real-time insights and analytics based on up-to-date data.
   - **Data Integration**: Keep data warehouses, data lakes, or other systems synchronized with operational databases.
   - **Event-Driven Architectures**: Trigger actions or workflows based on specific data changes, enabling reactive and event-driven applications.

### Benefits of CDC in Real-Time Scenarios:

- **Near Real-Time Updates**: Enables applications to react promptly to data changes without significant latency.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures that downstream systems have consistent and accurate data by capturing changes as they occur.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces the need for batch processing and manual data updates, improving overall system efficiency.
- **Business Agility**: Supports agile decision-making and responsiveness to market changes by providing timely data updates.

### Example Use Cases:

- **E-commerce**: Updating inventory levels and product availability in real time based on customer purchases.
- **Finance**: Monitoring transactions and detecting fraudulent activities as they happen.
- **Healthcare**: Tracking patient records and updating medical histories in real time across hospital systems.

In summary, CDC plays a crucial role in real-time data processing by capturing, propagating, and delivering data changes promptly across systems. This capability is vital for maintaining data integrity, supporting real-time analytics, and enabling responsive applications in modern data-driven environments.
