What are some of the algorithms you should know before taking system design interviews? <br>
I put together a list and explained why they are important. Those algorithms are not only useful for interviews but good to understand for any software engineer. <br>
One thing to keep in mind is that understanding “how those algorithms are used in real-world systems” is generally more important than the implementation details in a system design interview.<br>

What do the stars mean in the diagram?<br>
It’s very difficult to rank algorithms by importance objectively. I’m open to suggestions and making adjustments. <br>
Five-star: Very important. Try to understand how it works and why.<br>
Three-star: Important to some extent. You may not need to know the implementation details.<br>
One-star: Advanced. Good to know for senior candidates.<br>
